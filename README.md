Facebook clone homepage made with HTML and CSS

During my Frontend Fundamentals course from Pirple.com, I had multiple tasks and assignments to do using only HTML and CSS. The final exam consisted in cloning a website at our will, I chosed to clone the FB homepage. I have to point out again that I had to do this only with HTML and CSS, so only static frontend, no backend or interactive frontend.
